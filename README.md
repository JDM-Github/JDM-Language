# JDM-Language
JDM Language, Own Language created in C++

Introduction:
Welcome to JDMLanguage, a unique and practical programming language born out of curiosity and a desire for efficiency. It was created during a college vacation break when I was eagerly awaiting my second year. My motivation for developing this language was twofold: to combat boredom and to simplify coding in SDL (Software Development Language) by creating a language that I could fully understand and control.

About JDMLanguage:
JDMLanguage stands as a testament to the balance between freedom and constraint. It draws inspiration from Python's versatility while introducing its own distinctive features.

On the freedom side of things, JDMLanguage allows you to perform a wide range of operations on variables and lists without rigid constraints. For instance, you can assign a variable to be an integer at one moment and a string at the next, offering a flexible and adaptable coding experience.

Conversely, JDMLanguage also provides the option of imposing constraints by specifying data types for variables and lists. By doing so, you can ensure type consistency in your code. For example, you can declare a variable as a "jint" (integer) or "jstring" (string), enhancing predictability and maintainability.

JDMLanguage is more than a programming language; it's a tool to make your coding life easier and more manageable. While SDL integration is still in development, the potential it holds for simplifying your coding tasks is promising.
